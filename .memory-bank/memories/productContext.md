# Product Context: SuperCode Framework

## Problem Statement
Development teams need comprehensive AI assistance that goes beyond simple code completion. Current solutions lack:
- Coordinated multi-agent workflows for complex tasks
- Intelligent context management across sessions
- Specialized agents for specific development domains
- Integration with modern development tools and services
- Fine-grained control over AI behavior and decision-making

## User Experience Goals
- **Seamless Initialization**: One-command project setup with dual MCP foundation
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Agents automatically coordinate for complex tasks
- **Context Persistence**: Memory systems maintain project intelligence across sessions
- **Behavioral Control**: Users can fine-tune agent behavior with flags like --ultrathink, --orchestrate
- **Modern Tooling**: Integration with latest development tools and frameworks
- **Responsive Interface**: Fast, accessible web interface for all device types

## Success Metrics
- Complete project initialization in under 5 minutes
- 19 agents successfully handling specialized tasks
- 13 commands executing common workflows efficiently
- Zero context loss between sessions through dual memory systems
- Sub-3 second load times for landing page across all devices
- 100% TypeScript coverage with strict type checking
