# Project Brief: SuperCode Framework

## Overview
Comprehensive AI agent framework that supercharges OpenCode with MCP integrations, behavioral flags, and modular architecture. Provides 19 specialized agents, 13 commands, and 11 MCP server integrations for enhanced development workflows.

## Core Requirements
- Dual MCP foundation: Knowledge Graph + Memory Bank for structured and project memory
- 19 specialized agents covering all aspects of software development
- 13 command implementations for common development workflows
- 11 MCP server integrations for enhanced capabilities
- Behavioral flags for fine-grained agent control
- TypeScript/React landing page with modern build system
- GitHub Pages deployment with responsive design

## Goals
- Provide comprehensive AI agent ecosystem for software development
- Enable multi-agent orchestration for complex tasks
- Establish intelligent context management through dual memory systems
- Create standardized templates and patterns for consistency
- Support modern development workflows with behavioral flags
