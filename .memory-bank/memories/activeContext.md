# Active Context: SuperCode Framework

## Current Work Focus
- Memory Bank and Knowledge Graph initialization for dual MCP foundation
- CRUSH.md creation for agentic coding agent guidelines
- Framework documentation and agent coordination setup

## Recent Changes
- Created comprehensive CRUSH.md with build commands and style guidelines
- Initialized Knowledge Graph with core framework entities
- Generated Memory Bank templates for project documentation
- Established project structure for memory management

## Next Steps
- Complete Memory Bank file creation with SuperCode-specific content
- Set up agent relationships in Knowledge Graph
- Verify dual MCP foundation is fully operational
- Test framework initialization workflows

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Dual MCP integration approach for maximum memory efficiency
- TypeScript-first development with strict type checking
- Modular agent architecture for maintainability
- GitHub Pages deployment strategy for documentation

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Use behavioral flags (--ultrathink, --orchestrate, --safe, --performance) for task control
- Follow established agent and command template structures
- Maintain strict TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
- Use shadcn/ui components for UI consistency

## Learnings and Project Insights
- SuperCode requires both structured (Knowledge Graph) and project (Memory Bank) memory systems
- Agent orchestration is central to framework effectiveness
- Behavioral flags provide essential fine-grained control for different task types
- Template-driven development ensures consistency across agents and commands
