# Memory Bank Instructions: SuperCode Framework

## Purpose
This Memory Bank contains the complete context for the SuperCode Framework project. It serves as the single source of truth for all project information, enabling seamless continuation of work across sessions.

## File Hierarchy
The Memory Bank files build upon each other in a clear dependency structure:

```
projectbrief.md (Foundation)
├── productContext.md (Why & What)
├── systemPatterns.md (Architecture)
└── techContext.md (Technical Details)
    └── activeContext.md (Current State)
        └── progress.md (Status)
```

## How to Use
1. **Always start by reading ALL memory bank files** - this is mandatory
2. Update files after significant changes or discoveries
3. Maintain consistency across files
4. Use clear, actionable language
5. Document decisions and reasoning

## Memory Bank Structure

### Core Files (Required)
1. **projectbrief.md** - Foundation document defining project scope and requirements
2. **productContext.md** - Problem statement, user goals, and success metrics
3. **systemPatterns.md** - Architecture, technical decisions, and design patterns
4. **techContext.md** - Technologies, setup, constraints, and dependencies
5. **activeContext.md** - Current work focus and recent changes
6. **progress.md** - What works, what's left, and known issues
7. **memory_bank_instructions.md** - This file

## Update Triggers
Update Memory Bank when:
- Making significant architectural changes
