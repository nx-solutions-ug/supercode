# Progress: SuperCode Framework

## What Works
- ✅ Complete framework architecture with 19 specialized agents
- ✅ 13 command implementations for development workflows
- ✅ 11 MCP server integrations for enhanced capabilities
- ✅ Dual MCP foundation with Knowledge Graph and Memory Bank
- ✅ React/TypeScript landing page with modern build system
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment with responsive design
- ✅ Behavioral flags for fine-grained agent control
- ✅ Template system for standardized development
- ✅ CRUSH.md guidelines for agentic coding agents

## What's Left to Build
- 🔄 Memory Bank initialization and content population
- 🔄 Knowledge Graph entity relationships setup
- 🔄 Framework testing and validation workflows
- 🔄 Agent coordination testing scenarios
- 📝 Additional documentation and examples
- 🧪 Comprehensive testing suite beyond visual testing

## Known Issues and Limitations
- No traditional unit testing framework (relies on Playwright visual testing)
- Memory management requires careful coordination between dual MCP systems
- GitHub Pages limitations for server-side functionality
- Complex agent orchestration may need optimization for large projects

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Architecture**: Evolved from single-agent to multi-agent orchestration
- **Memory Systems**: Shifted from single memory to dual MCP foundation
- **Testing Strategy**: Focused on visual/functional testing over unit tests
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages chosen for simplicity and automatic deployment
- **Development Workflow**: Behavioral flags added for enhanced agent control
